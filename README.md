libgdx-udp-extension
====================

An experimental UDP extension for the LibGDX library. Can easily be ported to other libraries.

Goals
====================
The goals of this project is to create a simple UDP library that abstracts as much as possible away from the networking part making the developer's life easier and limiting the requirement of the knowledge in the area. 

Dependencies 
====================
The current dependencies are LibGDX. This can be very easily reported to other libraries or made standalone. If I get enough requests I'll put up a version that doesn't depend on LibGDX.

Support
====================
Issues can be placed on the issue tracker. The best way of contacting me would be on IRC.
